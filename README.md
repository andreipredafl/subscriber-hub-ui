# Subscriber Client

A simple Vue 3 client that interacts with a subscriber management API. I aimed to keep the code as simple as possible.

This project is part of a technical challenge and showcases frontend skills such as Vue.js components, state management, and API interactions. Of course, thereâ€™s room for improvement, such as adding better validation, notifications, and enhanced error handling :)

The backend API for this project is built with Laravel. Check it out [here](https://github.com/andreipredafl/subscriber-hub-api).

The UI and UX were loosely inspired by modern newsletter platforms and aim to provide a clean and intuitive experience.
