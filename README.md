# MailerLite Subscriber Client

A simple Vue 3 client that interacts with the MailerLite Subscriber API. I aimed to keep the code as simple as possible.

This project is part of a challenge and showcases frontend skills such as Vue.js components, state management, and API interactions. Of course, thereâ€™s room for improvement, such as adding better validation, notifications, and enhanced error handling :)

Hopefully, this serves as a good showcase of my skills! ðŸš€

The backend API for this project is built with Laravel. Check it out [here](https://github.com/andreipredafl/mailerlite-subscriber-api).

Inspired by [MailerLite interface](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/subscribers)
